      <h2>Positivity</h2>
      <p>
        Why is it that people are losing faith by the minute? That they don't
        believe anymore? Yes indeed, there are difficult times. And these
        difficult times are exactly what challenge you. They challenge you to
        come out smiling. The truth is, every situation is what the mind makes
        it to be. That's why they say that the mind is a magnet. Many people
        interpret this saying differently. Well, yes, all interpretations are in
        fact correct. Firstly, you attract what you think. If you're always
        negative, then negativity is what you get. Another thing is, each
        situation can be taken in a different way. If you make the best of
        everything, you'll have no reason to frown. Yes it is true, that there
        is a positive side to everything. So go out there and make the most of
        what you've got!!!

      <h2>Friendship</h2>
      <p>
        Friendship is the ultimate gift of God. If you've found a friend, you've
        found a treasure, which is to be cherished forever. Having a true friend
        is the best experience you'll ever have. They're there with you through
        the thick and thin. They laugh with you and cry with you. And you know
        that you can always count on them. They can lighten your mood in a
        second. You can tell them your deepest secret and can be absolutely sure
        its safe. They will always love you for you and won't ever judge you.
        But shouldn't we do our part too? Be as good a friend to them, as they
        are to us. I am extremely lucky to have found my best friend.... I hope
        you are too. FRIENDSHIP IS A TRUE DELIGHT!!!

      <h2>Live Life Your Own Way</h2>
      <p>
        It is no secret that everything has an end. That which is born, must one
        day die, and that which is started must one day be ended. And so is
        life. Life is a journey, not a destination. It is a journey to be
        enjoyed. So why do we hold back? Maybe it's because of the rules of the
        society. Yes, we have rules. To inculcate discipline, and to facilitate
        the way of life. It is important to respect them. But at the same time,
        it is also important to make sure that you live life to the fullest.
        Life is not meant to be spent locked behind bars. Be free and find out
        what makes you happy. Follow your dreams and don't let anything stop
        you. Embrace your own self. You don't need to change yourself just to
        meet the expectations of others. Live your life, your own way!!!
